  <!-- All forms start with a <form> element -->
  <h1>Form</h1>
  <!-- All of its attributes are optional, but it's standard practice to always set at least the action and method attributes:
  The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
  The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post). -->
  <form action="www.example.com" method="get">
    <!-- <form action="www.google.com" method="get"> -->
    
    <!-- The for attribute of <label> must be equal to the id attribute of the related element to bind them together. Each id should be unique  -->
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="username" placeholder="Enter you name" />
    
    <!-- For a <form> element, the name attribute is used as a reference when the data is submitted. -->
    <!-- Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) - because when a user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area).  -->
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="text" id="email" name="useremail" placeholder="Enter you email" />

    <!-- The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field - it goes away as we start to type -->

    <!-- <label for="search">Search:</label>
    <input type="text" id="pwd" name="search" /> -->
    <p><button>Sign In</button></p>
