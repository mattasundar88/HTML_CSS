/* Display Property - The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline box */
/* display: block;
The element generates a block box, generating line breaks both before and after the element when in the normal flow.

Width and height are respected

display: inline; 
The element generates one or more inline boxes that do not generate line breaks before or after themselves. In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there is space.

width and height are neglected - they do not apply
