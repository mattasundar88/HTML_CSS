  <!-- Lists are everywhere in lifeâ€”from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you are following in these tutorials! -->

  <!-- On the web, we have three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and description. -->
  <!-- Unordered and ordered lists are very common, and they're covered in this section. Description lists are less common -->

  <!-- Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter. -->
  <!-- Shopping List -->
  <h1>Lists</h1>
  <h2>Unordered List</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
    <li>Fruits
      <!-- Nested Lists - Discuss after Ordered Lists -->
      <ul>
        <li>Oranges</li>
        <li>Grapes</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- End -->
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter. -->
  <!-- Directions to follow -->
  <h2>Ordered List</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
    <li>Turn right</li>
    <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
    <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
    <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
  </ol>

  <!-- Any elements related on web page - the basic structure is a list and Navbar is build from lists.
  It is the styling which differs - remove the bullets, numbers etc. -->
