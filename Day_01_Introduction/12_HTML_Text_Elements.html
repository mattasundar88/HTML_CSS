  <!-- Emphasis -->
  
  <!-- In HTML we use the <em> (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as italic by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get italic styling. To do that, you'd use a <span> element and some CSS, or perhaps an <i> element. -->

  <!-- Strong importance -->

  <!-- In HTML we use the <strong> (strong importance) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more useful, again these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. Browsers style this as bold text by default, but you shouldn't use this tag purely to get bold styling. To do that, you'd use a <span> element and some CSS, or perhaps a <b> element. -->
  <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

  <!-- The bold tag should be used when we wanted to bring attention -->
