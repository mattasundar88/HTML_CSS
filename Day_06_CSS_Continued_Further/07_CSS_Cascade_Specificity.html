  <h1>CSS Cascade and Specificity</h1>
  <hr />
  <h3>
    The aim of this lesson is to develop your understanding of some of the most fundamental concepts of CSS.
  </h3>

  <h3>
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and that first word cascading is incredibly important to understand - the way
    that the cascade behaves is key to understanding CSS.
  </h3>

  <h2>Cascade</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>
    Stylesheets cascade - at a very simple level, this means that the origin, the cascade layer, and the order of CSS
    rules matter.
  </h3>

  <h2>Specificity</h2>
  <hr />
  <h3>
    Specificity is the algorithm that the browser uses to decide which property value is applied to an element
  </h3>

  <ul>
    <li class="list" id="item" style="color: black;">Item 1</li>
    <li class="list" id="item">Item 2</li>
    <li class="list" id="item">Item 3</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The specificity algorithm is basically a three-column value of three categories or weights - ID, CLASS, and TYPE -
    corresponding to the three types of selectors. The value represents the count of selector components in each weight
    category and is written as ID - CLASS - TYPE. The three columns are created by counting the number of selector
    components for each selector weight category in the selectors that match the element.
  </p>

  <h3>Selector weight categories</h3>
  <p>
    The selector weight categories are listed here in the order of decreasing specificity:
  </p>

  <h4>ID column</h4>
  <p>
    Includes only ID selectors, such as #example. For each ID in a matching selector, add 1-0-0 to the weight value.
  </p>

  <h4>CLASS column</h4>
  <p>
    Includes class selectors, such as .myClass, attribute selectors like [type="radio"] and [lang|="fr"], and
    pseudo-classes, such as :hover, :nth-of-type(3n), and :required. For each class, attribute selector, or pseudo-class
    in a matching selector, add 0-1-0 to the weight value.
  </p>

  <h4>TYPE columns</h4>
  <p>
    Includes type selectors, such as p, h1, and td, and pseudo-elements like ::before, ::placeholder, and all other
    selectors with double-colon notation. For each type or pseudo-element in a matching selector, add 0-0-1 to the
    weight value.
  </p>

  <h4>No value</h4>
  <p>
    The universal selector (*) and the pseudo-class :where() and its parameters aren't counted when calculating the
    weight so their value is 0-0-0, but they do match elements. These selectors do not impact the specificity weight
    value.
  </p>

  <h4>Inline styles</h4>
  <p>
    Inline styles added to an element (e.g., style="font-weight: bold;") always overwrite any normal styles in author
    stylesheets, and therefore, can be thought of as having the highest specificity. Think of inline styles as having a
    specificity weight of 1-0-0-0.
