  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Salieri">Antonio Salieri</a>
    believes that
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a>'s music is divine and
    miraculous. He wishes he was himself as good a
    musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. He
    began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a
    composer are God's rewards for his piety. He's also content as the
    respected, financially well-off, court composer of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Austrian Emperor Joseph II</a>. But he's
    shocked to learn that Mozart is such a vulgar creature, and
    can't understand why God favored Mozart to be his instrument. Salieri's
    envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart.
    He is ready to take revenge against God and Mozart for his own musical
    mediocrity

    <h3>A Genius Movie About A Genius</h3>
    <h4>10/10</h4>
    <p>
      I thought that it would be impossible to make a movie like this one!
      Peter Schaffer's original play inspired Milos Forman, the great czech
      film maker, that surprised the world with "One flew over the cuckoo's
      nest" (1975). The sublime, almost over-human performance by Frank Murray
      Abraham (the Mozart enemy and secret admirer, Salieri) is one of the
      keys for the movie success, mostly to it's depth. The perfect sense of
      timing by Milos Forman is admirable, he knows when to play wich music.
      All the scenarios: opera houses, palaces, streets, etc., are details
      absolutely harmonious! One of this classic secret was that Forman
      gathered "the" team, perfect team work.

    <h3>True Gem For Music Fans</h3>
    <h4>9.5/10</h4>
    <p>
      I'd like to point out a few facts before I review the movie. First of
      all, Mozart died at home surrounded by his family, pupil and a priest.
      Secondly, the plot of Amadeus is not exactly original. Rimsky-Korsakov
      wrote a short opera called "Mozart and Salieri" with the bare bones of
      the story and the identical characterization of the two composers, and
      he used Pushkin's drama for the libretto. So, the rumor that Salieri
      killed Mozart has been around for almost a couple of centuries though we
      all know there isn't an iota of veracity in it.
